# Music 2001 Reviews from Douglas Singleton

_You didn’t ask for it, and yet still you got it.   .   . my music choices for 2001_

## Scott Edmonds - "Afrofuturism and Nu Soul" (unreleased CD, Mechasoul)

Scott is a 2-Step DJ from the Bay Area. In May of 2001, on the last day I was in town for the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, there was a knock on my hotel door at 8 A.M. (I was in a "coma", having gotten back from partying 45 minutes beforehand and set to fly home to New York at 12 in the afternoon). It was Scott. We were supposed to hook up and hang during the festival but had somehow gotten wrapped up in whatever it was we were doing. I had been begging Scott for a "mixtape" ever since I’d first met him in Oakland during the spring of 2000 and he had promised to hook me up with something during the DEMF as we’d both be in town. I opened the door (hoping it might be someone of the female persuasion, ha! ha!) and was surprised to find Scott. Exhausted we mumbled what we’d been doing, gave each other a pound and hug, and he slipped me this CD. I threw it in my bag, finished throwing up in the toilet (that’s a joke, ma) and slept for another two hours before hitting the godawful Detroit airport. Nearly a year later this is the CD from 2001that most gives me pleasure. It’s a mix DJ set of not 2-Step but electro, techno-soul, straight soul, something resembling UK 2-Step Garage, straight up hard drum ‘n jungle, techno, and what I will call atmospheric "afrofuturism". What’s so clever about it from Scott’s standpoint is that though he’s nominally a 2-Step DJ (Jesus, whatever that means) the music on this CD for the most part circles around what 2-Step is supposed to be, not simply 21st Century breakbeat music, but 21st Century "AfrofuturaSoul". Cool and sneaky---this be the shit.
 

## N*E*R*D - "In Search Of . . ." (Virgin)

The Neptunes, superstar Pimp-Geek Virginia producers all over every-fuckin’-body on the planet’s records the last couple of years put together their own shit and blow minds. This is another one of those records released in the U.S. in 2002 but out in Europe during the fall and here on promo the summer of 2001. Weird in that the early promo was more "programmed" and polished after which they went back in the studio and re-recorded everything with live instruments and made it more "raw" and "live", "Steely Dan-ish" they like to say. Is it less hip-hop and more spoken-word Prince smothered in buzzing guitars? This is some un-definable shit. Smooth and nerdy hip-hop rock? Funky electronic country music? Pornographic Hendrix rap (X-rated producers’ vanity joint)? El Debarge backed by junior Led Zeppelin wannabes? (I keep trying to define this shit). I could see these motherfuckas at both some afterhours at 6 in the morning drinking Cristal pushin’ up on platinum blonde honeys and sitting around with a bunch of tech-y geeks talking about MIDIs and Les Paul guitars with nary a woman in sight. Futuristic falsetto funk? Is this record some kind of joke, or earnest indie-rock ghetto new wave posturing?
 
 

## Princess Superstar - "Princess Superstar Is" (!K7)

My freaky white indie-hip-hop soul sister. This shit is hype even though I know Concetta stole my boy’s cell phone a couple of months back (I kid you not). The production and songwriting are much more on point than her previous "Last of the Great 20th Century Composers". You gotta wonder what’s up with the Kool Keith thing though---be they intimate? Their duet is some of the funniest rhyming you are gonna hear on a record. Highlights:

Keith:

    "I’m mad Superfly in the bathtub
      I’m real
     Princess is chillin’ Superfriends 2001
     I’m the future Ron O’neal
     We gon’ drink some soft wine
      And watch a X-rated movie
      That’s hardcore."

Princess Superstar:

    "You and me like E.T. and Drew Barrymore.
      I won’t beat around the bush
      So you can beat around mine."

The song titles say it all really: "Bad Babysitter", "Keith ‘n Me", "Wet!Wet!Wet!" "You Get Mad at Napster", "I Love You (Or at Least I Like You). And she even has a really serious, deep groove of a rhyme on here that features Bahamadia. Ms. Superstar is undoubtedly a phenomenon, and way about ready to blow up now (at least in Europe). Can you say independent female empowerment? Concetta writes, plays the instruments, produces, promotes herself, does every fuckin’ thing. (Now if only my nigga could have his phone back? Your ass ain’t in Europe, somebody told me they saw you in the East Village last week!!)
 
 

## Moodyman - "forevernevermore" (Peacefrog)

Listen, when I say "techno", or "Detroit techno" this is what I really mean. Can you say, "post-modern disco"? Can you say, "of the revolution funky murky from the mud of the South metallic soul"? Then to you I say, Mr. Kenny Dixon Jr.'s "forevernevermore".  Technically originally out in 2000, but then solely on vinyl. The CD LP was released in 2001 with added voiceover interludes (one with Kenny’s daughter singing some song in the background as only a 6 year old child could. When her father asks her where her producer is she says, "in the ghetto"). There is something so pure, earthy, and primal about Kenny Dixon Jr.'s techno-soul musings as to nearly bring tears to the eyes. It is as if the year 1972 was filtered through a prism circa 2025, a drifting electric-soul fog, like that mecha kid in "AI" 'cept with a huge afro, family barbecues sifting through and clouding his memories. "dontyouwantmylove"?
 
 

## Radiohead - "Amnesiac" (Capitol)

After much reflection I’m still not sure if I like this more than "Kid A" or not, but really, it’s just a double album the record company split into two discs. They are both so obviously from the same sessions as to make considering them apart moot. Perhaps this is the alternate universe bastard cousin (with more guitars). Those crazy "underwater New Orleans horns" are still here. The weirdo effects are still here. The emotional whining is still here. Motherfuckas can playa-hate all they want but you aren’t gonna hear another song as oddly intricate, layered, and beautiful as "Pyramid Song". Just when you think you’re finished with guitars these boys "bring you back in". People be dismissive like, "Pink Floyd". I be like, "So what?". I’ll take looped piano flourishes, filtered vocals, and infused noise any day, especially all in the name of the future.
 
 

## De La Soul - "AOI: Bionix" (Tommy Boy)

Fifteen years from now, when hip-hop heads listen to records from the beginning of the century, they will pull out De La’s series of "Art Official Intelligence" records. Finally they will get it, but hopefully not too late. Yet another record I get tired of having to defend to people who should know better. Listen, it’s really simply a history of hip-hop (Busy Bee, the Beasties, Slick Rick), on to early De La itself, some of their contemporaries (Pharaoh Monch, Devin the Dude) on to what they feel hip-hop should mean now and in the future. It’s inherently black soul music (isn’t that what hip-hop is at its base anyway?). When I was young and wondered how hip-hop could mean something to me when I turned 30 this is what I should have been picturing. This is ADULT HIP-HOP. This is music you can play at your family barbecue and watch your uncle and aunt shake their asses to. Make love to. Rhyme to. Dance to (not just the ‘head’, but the throat arms, and legs). Corny at times? "Married" life filled with children and mortgages I fear is a little corny sometimes. De La refuses to run away from the fabric of their existence. C’mon, gospel-like hip-hop songs with Cee-Lo, impeccably produced by Posdnous (I really think sometimes that he is such a great composer as to be the Duke Ellington of our hip-hop times---I kid you not.). With lyrics like:

 "And when I’m watching the news
  And my daughter walks in and choose to ask,
  ‘Why were all those people on the floor
  Sleepin’ covered in rags?’
  I told her they were lookin’ for God
  But found religion instead."

How can you beat this shit? It’s "rough" too---I challenge anybody to find tracks with more flowing lyrical intensity than the track with Philly Black (or the track off of "Mosaic Thump" with the Alkaholiks). Soft? Um, I don’t think I’ll be letting my moms hear me pumpin’ that "Porn Star" track. The "weed" shit with B-Real from Cypress Hill is fuckin’ hilarious too. The review of this record in the Village Voice was a shameful misguided piece of shit, shame, shame, if you don’t get it, don’t front like you got it, let others say their peace too. (And stay tuned for AOI III, the series wrapped up with a DJ turntablist inspired session).
 
 

## Subfreq & Woogie - "Laboratory" (www.subfreq.org & www.boogiewoogie.org)

I don’t even know who these people are. The CD was given to me in the back room of that Drinkland place in the East Village by some DJ I’d been talking to at 3 or so in the morning during the Testpress drum ‘n bass party on Sunday nights. Ultimately it’s kinda like experimental drum ‘n bass: noises, sounds, crushing punk-ish jungle, sonic, expressively phat (beats), guitars. Quirky, dark, weird, with scary dialogue, atmospherics and stretches of re-mixed old vocals. Kids---this is what the future will sound like. If you can find any soundbites or songs here to market I’ll give you a cookie (or assassinate you). In the meantime---have that orgasm, you’ve reached aural heaven (or hell).
 
 

## Bilal - "1st Born Second" (Interscope)

There was so much hype coming out of Brooklyn concerning this brother that I figured there was no way in hell this record could possibly live up to it. Stories of his drunken (but brilliant) performance at the BAM cafe in Fort Greene a few summers ago, when he was still unsigned, added to the expectations (as did his guest spot all over the Common record). "Soul Sista" notwithstanding, I was ready to hate him. But I dig it, I dig it, I dig it. A lot of people don't, say it's a lot "slicker" than his raw, live sound, but I ain’t hearin’ that. Listen, it ain't "Voodoo", but then again, what is? I always need a "soul" record that I get into and jam to relentlessly in any given year and this is my present choice. Everybody know the Dr. Dre produced track, "Fast Lane", but there’s a lot of other deep shit on here too: "When Will You Call?", "Slyde", the Soulquarians produced "Sometimes (‘Wish my eyes wasn’t so red sometiiiiimes. . .’)". I been stealing his line from "For You" about being willing to "rob and steal" for his woman ever since I first heard it. I used to say a woman was so fine and righteous I was willing to "go to law school" for her but now it’s "rob and steal" (maybe the same thing?). Although naively silly sometimes, this is hype soul music for the people.
 
 

## The Strokes - "Is This It" (RCA)

This be approved by none other than my rockin’ guru Marcus Degrazia himself, who once told me, "Yeah, they wealthy rich kid fucks but the shit rocks for real." As you may have noticed, I don’t listen to a whole lot of rock music these days. I’m not sure why, or when it happened, it simply did. Arguably, back in ’92 most of what I listened to could have been construed as "rock", along with the obvious hip-hop and being in Chicago house. Sometime around ’95 (could it have been the oh-so-mammoth arrival of Jungle on these shores that did it?) I started to notice that I was pulling away from the punk and rock thing or whatever, especially the guitar, bass, drums, dudes, and three to eight chord thing. Just stopped feeling the world. I like possibilities in my music and the hip-hop/house/techno/drum ‘n jungle world offered me this. I rarely look back. That being said, (and I hate rule-like pronouncements), this was one of the "rock" records I listened to last year that moved me. (Would 2000’s "Teaches of Peaches" have counted as rock?). I first saw the video for "Last Night" on MTV2 while back home visiting Chicago and thought, "Is this some shit from the seventies I never heard before?" Velvet Underground-ish Pixie rush-me-up roots rock. Revolutionary, no. But then again, what is really? Real truth screaming groove guitar stars.
 
 

## Daft Punk - "Discovery" (Virgin)

I get so tired of non-house/techno people tossing their "hate" of Daft Punk at me, especially at the track "One More Time". Listen, it’s a matter of aesthetics: there is a world and sphere where the euphoric, simple, garage-y house of this track is the very nature of purity in music itself (especially the Armand Van Helden re-mix, which stretches out the length of the techno-y loop that anchors the track, making for a 2 minute entrance and exit that just intensifies the beauty of the vocals once they kick in. Talk about trance-like beauty). You either get it or you don’t. If you do, or choose to attempt to follow, you get to a place that is not unlike that moment before you orgasm stretched over an indefinite, extended moment of time. (Shit, when I first "got" Music Sounds Better with You on the dancefloor in Miami during the Winter Music Conference ‘99---I blacked out into a netherworld for 20 minutes or so---motherfucka Sneak had dropped it on me). And how people can go on and on about that Basement Jaxx record, mediocre at best, and fail to recognize the intensity of this record is beyond me. Aerodynamic? High Life? Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger? Digital Love? These are like house based paeans to the future and the ‘70’s (or ‘80’s, and ‘90’s). This record is so good that people who don’t get it don’t even deserve to ever get it. I know the whole "it’s no ‘Homework’" crowd, and you know what? You’re right. That’s the point. Capitalistic excessive be these masked boys sometimes? Yep. Over the top quirkiness? Yep. Brilliant? You better fuckin’ believe it. "Too Long" should have been stretched out for another fuckin’ 15 minutes or so itself.
 
 

## Cannibal Ox - "The Cold Vein" (Def Jux)

Post Sept. 11 it took me over a week to begin listening to music again---usually a day without music is a laughable impossibility in my life. The first music I listened to was John Coltrane’s "Alabama". I felt the world in that song. Later, as the "new" world came clearer into view, I found myself often listening to a song off this album, "Iron Galaxy", it’s actually an old track that has been out on vinyl for years and pretty much states what Vast Aire and Vordul think about the world in general and New York in particular. The song is harsh, crushing, and poetic. There’s a line in it that goes, "New York is evil at its core." Or rather, well, more:

"Infested with money and diamond cluster
Lets talk in laymen terms
Rotten apples and big worms
Early birds and poachers
New York is evil at its core
So those who have more than them
Prepare to be vic-tims
Ate up by vultures
The politicians
In a dog eat dog culture
That'll sick 'em."

During the rest of September and October I’d sometimes recite these lines drunkenly to people and they’d look at me like I was insane, which I probably was. Anyway, this record is like ghetto Chomsky filtered through freestylin’ Big Men on Campus, the campus being Harlem and the Lower East Side. A lot of Hot 97 people detest this kind of hip-hop. Cannibal Ox are compadres of the whole Company Flow-style crews (El-P produced it). Whatever it is, it’s urgent hip-hop. When last you heard that?
 
 

## Richie Hawtin - "DE9 | Closer to the Edit" (Novamute)

This is your brother’s techno. And not just because it’s cool and mucho Detroit (alright, Ontario), hard and smooth, black and "German", intellectual and ass groovin’. Mr. Hawtin is one of those few "techno" DJ’s left whose center of gravity may be outside of Detroit but who manages still to groove and be "hard". A few other DJs do it but I don’t know too many producers who do. (Of course, I live in New York). "DE9 | Closer to the Edit" is one of those complicated "technical" concept records in that, well, let Mr. Hawtin speak for himself: "After recording, sampling, cutting, and splicing over 100 tracks down to their most basic components, I ended up with a collection of over 300 loops, ranging in length from 1 note to 4 bars. I then started to recreate and reinterpret each track, putting the pieces back together as if an audio jigsaw puzzle ? using effects and edits as the glue in between each piece. This 53 minute piece, consisting of over 70 tracks and 31 ID points, represents what those loops became, and how their interactions created something that had not existed before". And the shit fuckin’ grooves like apple syrup in the summer time too. I be rockin’ it in the afternoon like I got let into that groove heaven we all dreamed of. Makes me proud of American techno (oops, I mean Canadian!!).
 
 

## Felix Da Housecat - "Kittenz and The Glitz"

Groovalicious! ha! ha! House? Retro-Electro (so in these days)? New New-Wave? Brotherman really surprised the hell out of me with this joint, and European heads be all over it. Sexy and fun, collaborator Miss Kitten’s stream-of-consciousness nonsensical glamour lyrics are either extremely hilarious or some kind of intellectually stimulating haiku, depending on how you listen to them. With funkified androids, Hawaiian guitars, chicks, pimps, and shag rugs, this is naked party music. There is one song on here that seriously sounds like a slow jam from the Michael Jackson "Off the Wall" sessions too, as produced by Kraftwerk. This is the most kooky downtempo house record since Dmitri from Paris’ "Sacre Bleu", and a lot of fun. Chicago in the house!!!
 

*Notable missing genres on my list: Latin, girl bands, "world", jazz, hard rock, punk . . . I acknowledge these holes in my contemporary listening.
 

## *Honorable Mentions (mainly ‘cause I don’t own many of them):

Bjork - "Vespertine"

Mary J. Blige - "No More Drama"

The White Stripes - "White Blood Cells"

Alicia Keys - "Songs in A Minor"

Derrick Carter - "Live at Slick’s"
 
 

(And for those of you who received my "Film 2001" picks, I've since added three additional films to the list. If ever I get to see that Donnie Darko film I suspect it might be added also. I've been trying to catch midnight showings of it on Friday and Saturday nights for months but haven't been able to as of yet---you know I'm usually in bed by then.)   : )
 

The Gleaners and I by Agnes Varda

If you’d like to renew your faith in and love for the human race check out this wonderful documentary by 70 year old master filmmaker Agnes Varda, a pure and extraordinary film. "Gleaners" are those who scavenge for leftover produce or any material society has seen fit to leave behind, discard. They search through potato fields, apple orchards, streets lined with furniture and junk, garbage cans. Varda and a digital video camera travel throughout France interviewing those who "glean" in all its guises. In compelling voiceover she contemplates what it means to scavenge through society’s leftovers (constantly questioning if she herself is a special sort of gleaner by searching out and recording images from the lives of others). This film is about the essence of objects, food, community, sharing, the beauty of garbage, recycling materials as well as art. In many ways it hints at a disgust with the global economy and its inherent cruelty, a blatant waste of the planet’s resources. Quirky, weird, brilliant, I’d love to one day evolve into any one of the people chronicled in this film, I really would.
 

Monster’s Ball by Marc Forster

I am trying to recall if I remember any "false" moments in this film. For so much of it everything just seemed so real and intense that my belly knotted up. I almost cried watching this, not so much because of anything that happened but because of a general awareness of existence’s malaise it conjured up. God, Halle Berry and Billy Bob were really good. The sex scene looked as if it truly evolved into some kind of emotional porno to me. Her drunk scene reminded me of "Once Were Warriors". Pure sadness, how much sadness can any two people take? There are very few films that I think exist in "defense" of interracial love, but this is one of them, organically so. When I think of true "American" film, this is the kind of thing that comes to my mind. Exquisite.
 

Baise Moi by Virginie Despentes & Coralie Trinh Thi

Quasi-feminist French porno flick, "Thelma & Louise"-like murderous sex snuff film in grainy digital video. I’m not gonna like this movie, c’mon?
