## Topic: Race, Music, and Recollections of Personal History

I want first to thank the Bored Collective for the opportunity to share with all of you tonight.

Coming from "upper" class Black southern traditions in Virginia, I moved to the Bay Area in 1998. I sometimes believe it was for search of self.

As an adult I have fond memories of studying the violin and the frequencies that it resonated; translating into neuronal pulse patterns that excited my brain.

Mostly, I remember my love for toys, computers, and boxes. Yes, boxes. It was the “magical realism” that I could create from something so ordinary—making a fantastic way out of nothing.

Now could not the idea of “magical realism” be considered the essence of soul.

Ahhh, soul. It’s a word so liberally used in pop/underground culture to reference music, fashion, a swaggering gate, or quite simply what is “qool”. I spell “cool” with a “Q”.

I, however, offer you, my audience, a historical reconstruction of the continuity of soul.

__The soul tradition is a prime cultural force in American pop/ underground music. Born of the 1960s, soul has provided a musical and cultural foundation for every type of contemporary music.__

__Its’ messages and philosophies communicated and developed the collective sensibilities of the black communities unwillingness to endure adverse conditions. Taking up topical problems and providing solutions, soul speaks to a Black aesthetic, ethnic consciousness, self-acceptance, and awareness. Finding oneself and hope for the future. This last part is something to which all in this room can relate.__

However, I offer you my double consciousness— a sense of seeing oneself through the eyes and ways of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt. A sort of unabated disregard for cultural continuity made apparent in as much the laptop squelchings of IDM songs about “S.F.” or “Rocking the Parti” as the gunshot chants of junglist who have little command of the real “jungle” in Kingston, Jamaica.

These are only observations that I have made. However, it doesn’t stop there. The contempt permeates through every flyer, website, magazine, or record label that purposefully uses culturally-based images, rhythms, or idioms to connote hip or “cool”.

Covers from such labels as Naked Music, local fliers and posters for events, and graphics found in such magazines as _XLR8R and FLYER_.

I will not speak tonight on past analysis such as those of James Baldwin or Norman Mailer—only of my own observations. I speak to your musical ids, night-time egos, and artistic integrity, so as that you will become cognizant of dynamic patterns in society.

In 2002, the era of 21st century soul, as a descendent of a beautiful experience, I will no longer accept the misappropriation of my culture’s music, images, and idioms. I’m done with my observations and ready to check [persons on inappropriate behavior and character].

_Quote from Nikki Giovanni, a fellow Fisk University alumnus: “The music was born because of our treatment by others, and the more they steal it the more they prove how little regard they have for us. The more we support their thievery the more we show what little regard we have for ourselves.”_
