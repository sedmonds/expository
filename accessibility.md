# On the Elder Digerati: Internet Usability and Accessibility as Relating to Older Adults 


At the turn of the 21st century, the online digital revolution is upon us: it has arrived and has had a great impact on the lives of many worldwide.  The Internet— pseudonym for the worldwide system of interconnected computer networks made accessible to the public— has redefined the ages; creating new user patterns (ie. online and secured shopping) and creating a vehicle for the instantaneous exchange of ideas between individuals (ie. email and exchange servers).   Indeed, various surveys indicate that two-thirds of all Americans are now online.  This number is growing and includes a significant number of older adults in its’ total.  In examination of the benefits which this technological utility provides for the elder population, the main issues to be addressed in this paper will be: demographics of the current online universe, usability, with regards to universal web design, and general accessibility.
	
As for demographics, nearly 126 million people were online by August 2003.  One of the resources assessed for this paper, the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Internet & American Life Project studies the social and civic impact of the Internet and “surveys not only what people think about the technology but also how they use it: for example, to expand their educational and religious activities, learn about health care, engage in politics and build relationships with family and friends.” (Fox, 2001)  In regards to their findings on Net use and demographics, surveys indicate that while growth of users is rising exponentially, not all groups are utilizing the technology or sharing in online activities equally.  The report for Pew indicates that “African-Americans, older Americans, and those with lower levels of education and household income who use the Internet are not engaging in many online activities at the same rate as the average Internet user. Considering these users’ recent exposure to the medium, these trends may shift as these users gain more experience online.” (Pew, 2004) And in regards to age, the Pew report indicates:
 			
While young adults who use the Internet (ages 18-29) have consistently paved the way with specialized online communication tools like IM and chat, and continue to lead in most hobby and entertainment activities such as downloading music and going online for fun, those aged over 50 have exhibited considerable increases in information utility and financial and transaction-related activities since 2000. For instance, wired 50- to 64- year- olds and wired seniors who seek political information have grown by almost 10 percentage points. And wired seniors who search for health information online or do online banking have both jumped up a whole 20 percentage points. The 30-49 age group is also strong in these categories; these users have become the most likely to look for government information online, do research for their job, or buy a product online, for example. 

Truly, the more relevant the information and destinations on the Internet becomes to older adults, usage numbers will increase exponentially.

However, one must ask what good is a product if it has no or little utility? How useful is information on the Internet if a person cannot find it? So important is the issue of usability, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has created a website (www.usability.gov), which is dedicated to the integral art and business of creating useful web sites/interfaces for the general public.  Defining usability as “the measure of the quality of a user's experience when interacting with a product or system — whether a web site, a software application, mobile technology, or any user-operated device”, the organization pinpoints five main factors that work in tandem to create a more meaningful experience for the user. The five main factors are:

1. Ease of Learning: How fast can a user who has never seen the user interface before learn it sufficiently well to accomplish basic tasks?

2. Efficiency of Use: Once an experienced user has learned to use the system, how fast can he or she accomplish tasks?

3. Memorable: If a user has used the system before, can he or she remember enough to use it effectively the next time or does the user have to start over again learning everything?

4. Error frequency and Severity: How often do users make errors while using the system, how serious are these errors, and how do users recover from these errors?

5. Subjective Satisfaction: How much does the user like using the system?

[Usability Definition](http://usability.gov/basics/index.html#definition)


In terms of utility and usability, most elder adults use the Internet to find information concerning health-related matters and/or government-related concerns.  Though fewer older adults are as wired as their younger counterparts, a high number of seniors engage with life through hobbies, television, reading the newspaper, or listening to the radio.  However, those that do engage in Internet activities mostly utilize email applications to communicate with friends/ family and co-workers, if computers are utilized in the work place or in the home.

Although, Internet use among this segment of the population is growing (4% of total Internet users), the older population has specific needs that must be addressed.  In addition to the basic user interface requirements (ie. that sites have relevant information and utility), it is also important that the Net be accessible to those with declining faculties (ie. formats for the visual and hearing impaired). A few sites offer text-to-speech content as well as text-to-Braille format, such those run by the National Institute on Health. Seemingly as technology improves, elder adults will benefit from “transparency”.

There are computers in devices such as cars and alarm clocks; this technology is transparent.  These devices require significantly less interaction and learned aptitude to use and maintain.  Therefore, the type of accessibility is different and often less frustrating.  One does not encounter viruses, spam, or useless search results while attempting to re-heat last night’s dinner. However, it is the viewpoint of this writer that both education and marketing can broaden the horizon for these older not-so-wired adults. Thereby creating a surplus of goods and services geared towards this demographic.  If more goods and services are geared towards this group, they are more likely to interact with this kind of technology; thus generating an even more expansive Net market.  

Stated earlier in this paper was the fact that older adults were less likely to have used the Internet for online shopping and/or downloading/ streaming music or video.  Indeed, studies show that most elders are on the losing side of the “digital divide” and those with few economic resources have little or no access to the Internet at all.  

Accessibility and usability are truly critical issues to providing a superior online experience.  Sites such as SeniorNet.COM offer the elder user pertinent information relating to health, business, veteran information, politics, as well as information about centers or educational outlets to gain valuable computer (web-based) skills.  

Truly, the Elder Digerati of the “Silver Tsunami” are gaining momentum and the largest segment of wired seniors.  According to a Pew Trust report, those fifty and older have become adept at basic computer use.  Whether this is do to having children in the family or working in a wired environment, those at the tale end of the age wave are savvy.  And this ability to stay connected to new frontiers will do wonders to create more opportunity for enrichment and education.  And as we become an older society, the need for access to resources becomes apparent and essential.  The Internet is part of that step and will serve to further the notion of bringing people and information together.  Indeed, knowledge is power and the digital exchange of ideas between old and young will become more important as time rolls on.
